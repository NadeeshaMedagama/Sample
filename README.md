- Git installed on your system

### Running the Code

#### JavaScript Files

```bash
# Run the first.js file
node first.js

# Run the basic.js file
node New/basic.js
```

#### Python Files

```bash
# Run the sample.py file
python Sample/sample.py
```

## 📖 Content Overview

### JavaScript Examples (`first.js`)

This file demonstrates:
- Console output with `console.log()`
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with ES6 classes
- Constructor functions and class methods
- Working with arrays of objects
- Iterating through collections

**Key Concepts:**
- Class declaration and instantiation
- The `this` keyword
- Array iteration with `for...of` loops

### JavaScript Fundamentals (`New/basic.js`)

Comprehensive examples covering:
- Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- Data types and type conversion
- DOM manipulation
- User input with `prompt()`
- Event handling
- Math operations
- String manipulation
- Conditional statements
- Functions and arrow functions
- Arrays and array methods

### Python Basics (`Sample/sample.py`)

Simple Python examples including:
- Print statements
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Loop structures (`for` loops with `range()`)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
